We're currently looking for a Senior Lead Engineer who has a strong foundation in algorithm development and a knack for leading dynamic teams. Given your experience as CEO & Founder, where you led the development of a revolutionary data compression algorithm, and your previous role as a Software Engineer at Hooli, we believe you could be a great fit for our team here at Netflix.

In this role, you'd have the opportunity to work on cutting-edge projects that align with your experience and passion for developing technology that ensures data privacy and shapes the future of the internet.

Before we proceed, I'd love to learn a bit more about you and discuss how your aspirations align with our mission. Could you please provide me with the following details:

What is your current CTC (Cost to Company)?
What CTC are you expecting for a new role?
And lastly, we're curious, what's motivating your decision to consider a change at this point in your career?
Your answers will help us understand your expectations and ensure that we can match them effectively.

Looking forward to hearing from you soon!
