**Note**: To fully harness the capabilities of Applibot, particularly the ones that interact with the GPT-4 model, you'll need an OpenAI API key that can access GPT-4. As of now, the GPT-4 access is a premium feature. Ensure you possess the necessary permissions.

**Steps to Obtain an OpenAI API Key:**

1. **Sign Up on OpenAI**: Navigate to the [OpenAI website](https://openai.com/) and create an account.
2. **Verify Your Account**: Confirm your account through the verification link sent to your email.
3. **Login**: Use your credentials to log in to your OpenAI account.
4. **Access API Section**: Click on your account name at the top right and select "View API keys".
5. **Generate a New Key**: Click "Create new secret key", name it appropriately, and then generate.
6. **Copy & Store Your Key**: Securely copy and store this key; it won't be retrievable again.
7. **Billing Setup**: Ensure you have a payment method associated for any API usage charges.
8. **Set Usage Limits**: Control your expenditure by setting monthly API usage limits.

## Installation

To install and set up the application, you can either use a virtual environment or Docker:

### Virtual Environment Setup:

1. **Create a virtual environment and activate it**:
    ```bash
    python3.9 -m venv ./venv
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```

2. **Install the application**:
    ```bash
    pip install .
    ```

### Docker Setup:

1. **Build the Docker image**:
    ```bash
    docker build -t applibot:latest .
    ```

## Configuration

Before running the application, you will need to set up your configuration file. You can start by copying the sample configuration and modifying it to suit your needs.

1. **Copy the sample configuration file**:
    ```bash
    cp sample-server-config.yaml my-config-file.yaml
    ```

2. **Edit the configuration file**:
    ```bash
    nano my-config-file.yaml
    ```

***Important*:** Ensure that your** OpenAI API key** (`chat-model.key` and `embeddings-model.key`) is correctly configured and has access to the required models and services, as the GPT-4 model is a paid service and requires proper authentication and authorization.

   Save and exit the editor.

## Run

Depending on your installation method, choose the appropriate run command:

### For Virtual Environment:

```bash
python -m applibot.server --config my-config-file.yaml
```

This will start the application, making it accessible on the specified host and port in your configuration file (default is `0.0.0.0:9000`).

### For Docker:

Ensure that the path to your configuration file is correctly mapped:

```bash
docker run \
    -p 9000:9000 \
    -v $(pwd)/my-config-file.yaml:/usr/src/app/my-config-file.yaml \
    -v $(pwd)/my-data/:/usr/src/app/my-data/ \
    applibot:latest
```

The Docker container will start, and the application will be accessible on the host's port `9000`.


## Postgres setup
```
docker run -itd -e POSTGRES_USER=applibot_user -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=change_this_password -p 5432:5432 -v ./my-data/postgresql:/var/lib/postgresql/data --name postgresql postgres
```
